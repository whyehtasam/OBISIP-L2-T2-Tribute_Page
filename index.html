            <h2>A visionary scientist</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Born in Basra, Iraq, around the year 965, Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham, Latinised as Alhazen or Alhasen, was a
                pioneering scientific thinker who, from his observation of light entering a dark room, made major
                breakthroughs in understanding light and vision.
                <br>
                <br>
                He set new standards in experimental science and completed his influential Book of Optics sometime
                around 1027.

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <br>
            <p>

                Ibn al-Haytham is widely considered to be the father of modern optics. He made significant contributions
                to the understanding of vision, reflection, refraction, and the nature of light. His work laid the
                foundation for many of the optical devices that we use today, such as eyeglasses, telescopes, and
                microscopes.
                <br><br>
                Al-Haytham's most influential work is his book Book of Optics, which he wrote in the early 11th century.
                In this book, he laid out his theory of vision, which was based on the idea that light rays travel from
                objects to the eye, rather than from the eye to objects. He also described the phenomenon of refraction,
                which is the bending of light rays as they pass from one medium to another.
                <br><br>
                Al-Haytham's work was translated into Latin in the 13th century, and it had a major influence on the
                development of optics in Europe. His work was cited by many of the great scientists of the Renaissance
                and Scientific Revolution, including Roger Bacon, Galileo Galilei, and Johannes Kepler.
                <br><br>
                Al-Haytham's legacy is not just limited to optics. He also made contributions to other fields of
                science, such as mathematics, astronomy, and physics. He was a true polymath, and his work had a
                profound impact on the development of science in the Islamic world and beyond.

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Ibn al-Haytham was born in Basra, Iraq in 965 AD. He was a brilliant student, and he excelled in
                mathematics, astronomy, and physics. After completing his studies in Basra, he traveled to Cairo, Egypt,
                where he served as a tutor to the Fatimid caliph.
                <br><br>
                In Cairo, al-Haytham began his studies of optics. He was particularly interested in the question of how
                vision works. Al-Haytham conducted a series of experiments to test his theories, and he eventually
                developed a new model of vision. His model was based on the idea that light rays travel from objects to
                the eye, rather than from the eye to objects.
                <br><br>
                Al-Haytham's work on optics was groundbreaking. His theories and experiments laid the foundation for
                many of the optical devices that we use today. He is considered to be one of the most important
                scientists of the Islamic Golden Age.

            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Here are a few of Ibn al-Haytham's quotes:
<br><br>
                "The light reaching the eye is reflected from the object, not emitted by it."
                <br><br>
                "The eye is like a mirror in that it receives the images of objects, but it is different from a mirror
                in that it sends those images to the brain."
                <br><br>
                "The mind is the one that sees, not the eye."
                "Science is the knowledge of the essence of things."
                <br><br>
                "The best way to learn is by doing."
                <br><br>
                These quotes give us a glimpse into Ibn al-Haytham's scientific philosophy. He was a critical thinker
                who believed in the importance of experimentation and observation. He was also a humanist who believed
                that science should be used to benefit society.
